            <p style="width: 26rem;"><strong>Nilai , July 26, 2024 :</strong> A young man was apprehended yesterday at a routine roadblock for attempting to bribe a police officer. The incident occurred when the driver was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Upon being informed that he would receive a ticket for the violation, the man allegedly offered a sum of money to the officer in an attempt to avoid the penalty. The officer, adhering to the strict anti-corruption policies in place, immediately rejected the bribe and placed the man under arrest.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Authorities have charged the individual with attempting to corrupt a public servant, a serious offense under Malaysian law. This incident highlights ongoing efforts to combat corruption within the nation's law enforcement and uphold the rule of law.</p>

                <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;" align="justify">Corruption is a long-standing and serious problem in Malaysia. It affects all areas of politics, business and education, and it has also affected Malaysia's reputation. Although the Malaysia government and anti-corruption agencies such as the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) are working hard to crack down on criminals and educate the public on the seriousness of corruption. But corruption still exists in Malaysia, from the 1MDB scandal to police corruption, which highlights the seriousness of the problem. Despite its deep-rooted nature, the problem of corruption can be mitigated through sustained joint efforts and continuous reforms by all sectors of society.

                <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;" align="justify">Police corruption in Malaysia is a long-standing and well-known problem involving illegal activities such as bribery, solicitation of bribes and abuse of power. The Malaysia police are most often perceived to be implicitly soliciting bribes from people on the road in order not to issue tickets, which has come to be known as "coffee money". The publicized scandals have captured the attention and resonance of the public, which has greatly affected the public's confidence in the law enforcement agencies. Despite the efforts of the government and various agencies to combat and improve these behaviors, the Malaysia police still cannot be associated with integrity. However, there is a segment of the population that believes that there is a reason for this, and the reasons for the corruption of the Malaysia police will be explored in this assignment.

                <p>Research methodology is a technique and procedure used to identify and analyse information on a specific research topic to ensure that the research results are valid and reliable (Sreekumar, 2023).</p>
                <p> In this study, we employ content analysis to investigate police corruption. The purpose is to understand the causes, information and effects of police corruption. We analyzed a range of sources including news reports, journals and books. We also identified relevant literature by searching for keywords such as “police” and “causes of corruption”. A preliminary review via malaysiamail shows that Malaysia's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score for 2022 was 47 which is the lowest in a decade that prompting a review of police corruption in the country.</p>
                <p>Channel News Asia reports also show that in the past ten years, more than 1,600 police officers in Malaysia have been dismissed due to crimes which shows that there are systemic problems. Abramson & Denenberg, P.C., a professional law firm also states that factors that contribute to police corruption include a lack of accountability, low wages and financial pressures, inadequate training and systemic problems. Reports and case studies show police corruption threatens social security, increases the cost of public services and has a negative impact on the tourism industry through police extortion of tourists as mentioned in the New Straits Times report.</p>
                <p>Overall, our content analysis provides insight into the serious problem of police corruption in Malaysia and highlights the need for effective measures to combat corruption to maintain a fair society.</p>

        <h2 class="h2title paddingend">Research Finding</h2>
        <div class="container8 paddingend">
            <div class="con5sub1">
                <h3>1.	Lack of accountability and oversight</h3>
                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >Police corruption in Malaysia is rooted in poor oversight and weak accountability mechanisms, which have led to police officers believing that they can engage in corrupt activities with impunity. Weak internal controls, ineffective disciplinary actions and the absence of an independent oversight body exacerbate the problem. The lack of strong oversight allows corrupt practices to flourish unchecked, as police officers believe they will not face significant consequences. The severity of the problem is underscored by Malaysia's score of 47 out of 100 on the Corruption Perceptions Index 2022 (CPI 2022), the worst in a decade, according to Transparency International. Weak internal controls and ineffective disciplinary measures further contribute to the growth of corruption, highlighting the urgent need to strengthen accountability and oversight mechanisms to combat the problem. (Razak, 2023)</p>        
            </div>
        
            <div class="con5sub1">
                <h3>2.	Low wages and economic pressure</h3>
                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Police salaries are often insufficient to support their families or meet their financial needs, which forces some to resort to corrupt practices, such as accepting bribes or engaging in illegal activities to supplement their income. The economic difficulties faced by police officers increase their temptation to seek quick financial gains through corrupt means, thus creating a cycle of corruption. The highly stressful nature of police work, coupled with feelings of underpayment, undervaluing and disrespect from the communities they serve, may lead police officers to view corruption as a form of compensation for their efforts and risks. (Denenberg, 2021) In addition, in an environment where corruption is prevalent, police officers may perceive corrupt behaviour as normal or justified. This perception is further exacerbated by a culture within the police department that either passively tolerates corruption or actively promotes it. When police officers see their colleagues engaging in corrupt activities without consequence, they may feel that such behaviour is acceptable or even expected. Addressing financial pressures, improving working conditions, increasing salaries, providing adequate support and fostering a culture of integrity within the police force are key steps in combating police corruption in Malaysia.</p>    
            </div>
            <div class="con5sub1">
                <h3>3.	Inadequate training and systemic factors</h3>
                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Inadequate training and systemic factors play a significant role in police corruption in Malaysia. Systemic problems such as lack of ethics training, poor leadership and a culture that values loyalty over integrity contribute to corrupt practices. New police officers often feel pressured to conform to these norms to fit in and advance in their careers. (Denenberg, 2021) In many cases, corrupt police officers are aware of their misconduct but believe that they will not be caught because of inadequate oversight. Police departments may fail to provide adequate training to prevent corruption, misconduct and violence. Specifically, new police officers often lack institutionalized ethics training, leaving them unaware of their ethical and legal obligations and the penalties for engaging in corruption. (Denenberg, 2021) This lack of training serves as a deterrent to ethical behaviour rather than to corruption. When serious police corruption is evident, it is usually an indication that the police department is either condoning a culture of corruption or turning a blind eye to it. New police officers may perceive such behaviour as the norm and act, accordingly, perpetuating the cycle of corruption. Addressing these systemic issues through comprehensive ethics training, strong leadership, and a culture that emphasizes integrity is critical to combating police corruption in Malaysia</p>        </div>

                    <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >Police corruption poses a serious threat to the security of society. Police may choose selectively enforce the law in favor of individuals who offer bribes. According to the South China Morning Post, Malaysian police allegedly accepted cash from a British couple to pay for a traffic ticket on a road linking Penang and the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia Police Seek British “van Life” Couple over Traffic Stop Bribery Video, 2024). The alleged police officer in this incident gave the couple two options either to pay a RM300 fine or pay RM100 on the spot. This event shows how bribery enables people to avoid facing legal repercussions. In contrast, individuals who are unable to afford or unwilling to give bribes may face serious legal consequences. Instead of combating crime, a corrupt police force protects criminals and enables criminal behavior to thrive. Police cover-ups enable criminals to continue their illegal activities. It leads to a steady rise in crime, which directly threatens the safety of public's lives and property. Society's peace and stability are also threatened (Oris I. Jaen, n.d.).</p>

                    <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">        
                        According to the New Straits Times, Langkawi police are investigating an incident where police officers demanded RM100 from tourists for not wearing crash helmets on 30 January 2024 (Mukhtar, 2024). This kind of corrupt behaviour has seriously jeopardised the country's tourism industry. When tourists experience extortion and unfair treatment by the police, they feel unsafe and develop a negative view of the country. These negative experiences can quickly spread through social media. This will amplify the impact and potentially leading to a significant loss of the tourist numbers (Das & Dirienzo, 2010). Foreign tourists are a crucial source of income for many countries A decrease in tourism has a direct impact on industries like restaurants, hotels, transportation and so on (The Herald, 2017) . Not only that, police corruption once widely reported, it can seriously damage the country's international image and reputation. In the long run, this situation will also lead to a slowdown in overall economic development of the country (Akamavi et al., 2022).

                    <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;"><p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">This is my first experience participating in the production of a video about corruption. During this process, we collaborate on creating scripts, preparing props and using filming equipment. This project stands out from past projects because it involves thorough script writing, filming and a deeper analysis of corruption. However, I encountered some challenges in this project such as team communication and time management. Sometimes, our team will absence of effective communication. Team members fail to actively share their thoughts or updates, leading to a lack of information flow. In addition, due to improper time planning, we often need to finish the task quickly at the last stage. Therefore, I suggest setting a practical schedule to avoid running out of time. Developing a thorough schedule at the start of the project and setting aside sufficient time for editing and blogging in advance. Not only that, periodic inspections can be carried out in the middle of the project to ensure that all parts are carried out as planned and problems can be found and solved in time. This will enhance the overall project's quality and increase efficiency. Furthermore, I have gained a fresh insight into scripts. Initially, I perceived the script as a basic concept but it included diverse shooting scenes and dialogue. This discovery has been beneficial to me. Although I was not involved in editing, I learned how to shoot from multiple angles and positions during the shooting process to ensure smooth and coherent editing in the later period. Conducting extensive research and collecting data before filming helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of corruption in Malaysia. Following this project, I discovered the importance of exploring various possibilities and gaining knowledge simultaneously. This experience sparked my interest in filming and heightened my awareness of corruption in Malaysia. Overall, this unique experience has injected new vitality into my campus life.</p>        </div>

                    <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">I gained valuable insights and learned a lot during the few months I worked on this assignment with my team. One of the key takeaways is the importance of teamwork. While our collaboration was not the best, the thoughtfulness and teamwork displayed by each member ensured our project ran smoothly. We always support each other when we encounter obstacles, actively discuss and communicate to find the best solution. Although our assignment was completed successfully, I found that communication was crucial during group assignments. Our communication style favor individual expression and negotiation rather than cohesive coordination. This results in a lack of clarity and consistency in our collective thinking and goals. In addition, the experience of the filming process was very inspiring to me. We collaborated on every stage from choosing the film's theme and developing the script to developing photography storyboards, preparing props and researching shooting angles to achieve the desired effect.‌ Furthermore, I also gained a lot of knowledge during the preparation process of the blog activities. I learned web page creation methods, design concepts, content outlines, and gained expertise in a new area. Not only that but studying on corruption in Malaysia was an eye-opener for me and gave me a deeper understanding of the issue. Looking back on this experience, I have concluded that despite time constraints, active communication is crucial. Every team member should take the opportunity to express their opinion, which can lead to more innovative and effective ideas. Overall, this assignment enriched my problem-solving skills, increased my confidence in trying new approaches, and reinforced the value of teamwork. I believe the lessons and additional knowledge gained from this experience will benefit me greatly in my future endeavors.        </div>

Looking back at my past experiences in the team, I was often filled with bad times and bad moments, which left me with a slight shadow in my mind and body. However, through this group assignment, I was able to re-embrace group work, which was very successful, although there were a lot of obstacles, such as scheduling, filming skills and miscommunication. But we all take time out to discuss the issues together, not the one-man show. As we only had 6 weeks to complete the assignment, everybody’s got something to do, for example assignment and mid term, which resulted in the assignment not being completed by the planned deadline. In this co-operation, each person's position was clearly defined, and we all had a common goal to complete the filming. Everyone went into the film with a positive mindset, not with the mindset of just getting it done, everyone did their best to come up with ideas and efforts to improve the film. It was my first time as a cameraman, which brought me a new challenge, but everyone was very patient in teaching me how to get the results we were looking for, and I never got tired of reshooting time and time again, and I’m glad to feel the team was so united. In this collaboration, I also realised the importance of planning ahead, and my groupmates all played their part through their own strengths, such as proficient in documentation, creating a blog website, and film editing. Through deep reflection, I realised that as a cameraman, the lens is not only a tool for recording, but also a weapon that can change the future and society, so that more viewers can be inspired to take action against corruption by watching the video. I hope that this cautionary film will awaken more people to the problem of police corruption and to resist it. Lastly, this filming would have been difficult to complete without their help, and I am very grateful for everyone's time and dedication.</p>

                    <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Completing the assignment on Malaysian police corruption was an enriching experience, offering numerous learning opportunities from technical skills in filming and web production to an in-depth understanding of team dynamics and project management. In terms of filming, I learned the importance of pre-production planning, including developing detailed storyboards and shot lists.  Additionally, I gained valuable experience in creating a blog. I learned how to use website development tools to build a visually appealing and functional blog, which included creating content outlines and designing attractive ways to present information.

                    One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was working closely with my team. Each team member brought unique strengths to the table, like some excelled at filming and editing, while others were adept at creating compelling stories and meticulously handling coverage. Despite initial communication difficulties, we learned to support each other and solve problems by working together effectively. During this assignment we faced several challenges, particularly in terms of time management and coordination. Time constraints required us to work efficiently and prioritize tasks effectively. This taught me the importance of setting realistic deadlines and regularly checking progress to stay on track. Additionally, technical problems during filming and blog production prompted us to think creatively and find innovative solutions.
                    
                    Researching police corruption in Malaysia provided insights into systemic issues and the impact of corruption on society. This knowledge not only informed our assignment but also broadened my understanding of the importance of ethical practices and transparency. This assignment was a significant milestone in my personal and academic journey, reinforcing my belief in the power of teamwork and effective communication. The skills I gained will undoubtedly benefit me in future projects, and the in-depth understanding of corruption has sparked my interest in exploring related topics further.

                    <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">In this assignment on corruption, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the background of police corruption and its impact, although the culture of corruption has been a common stain in Malaysia, but after in-depth research, I found that there have been numerous cases of police bribery in Malaysia, but recently the ruling government's fight against corruption has pushed the country to get back on the right track. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been working on public awareness through different means, such as education, speeches and attending different events to educate the general public as well as the upcoming university students about corruption and how to deal with it. Besides, in this short film shooting, I have fully learned the concepts of filming and different ways of filming, and I have also gained more insights on the sub plotting, although there are some challenges in this group assignment, but we was able to complete them one by one, and each member of the group has done the part that each other should accomplish, although it is a short semester that leads to the overall time limit. Although it was a short semester which resulted in a shorter overall duration and the tasks were very urgent, but we all cooperated actively and made the overall process work, in general, this assignment allowed me to get in touch with the subject of "Corruption" which I seldom come into contact with in general and also gave me the opportunity to visualize the Malaysian society on the subject of corruption, which is a great opportunity for me. This is a good experience and an interesting learning process for me.</p>

                    <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">This project was unlike my prior ones in that it required a comprehensive effort, including scriptwriting, filming, and in-depth research on corruption in Malaysia. The lengthy research and joint efforts were very engaging, allowing us to delve deeply into the subject matter. Working as a director on a video exposing corruption was an enormously enriching experience that gave me a fresh perspective on filmmaking and social concerns. The semester's short duration resulted in a heavy workload and occasionally insufficient information sharing among the team members, which highlighted the need for better communication strategies and more structured planning. However, as a director, I gained significant knowledge about the technical aspects of filmmaking, such as the importance of writing a precise script and filming from many viewpoints to ensure smooth editing. This encounter piqued my interest in filming and enhanced my understanding of police corruption in Malaysia. Bribery is widespread in the country, but new initiatives by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) aim to increase public awareness and promote honesty. Additionally, the experience underscored the importance of ethical considerations in storytelling and the power of media in shaping public discourse. Overall, this program was a valuable learning experience that helped me strengthen my teamwork and time management abilities, sharpen my leadership skills, and deepen my appreciation for the complexities involved in addressing societal issues through creative expression. This has not only enriched my academic experience but also provided a new and exciting challenge for my campus life, encouraging me to pursue further exploration in the field of media and communication.</p>

                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >The founder of Transparency International, Peter Eigen has said that people need to be aware that they have the power to transform a corrupt system (Transparency Int’l, 2018). This one belief emphasizes the importance of individuals or groups in driving systemic change. As a Malaysian citizen, we need to unite preventing corrupt practices to safeguard the well-being of our society and economy. In order to prevent corruption from entering into a deadly cycle, we should act proactively. Therefore, the government can establish a system for reporting corrupt activities anonymously. It is to protect whistleblowers and encourage more people to expose corrupt conduct. Malaysian people are encouraged to participate in combating corruption to help decrease the country's crime rate. We must collaborate as a team to eliminate corruption. By working together, we can forge a more optimistic future for our nation.</p>
