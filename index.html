            <p style="width: 26rem;"><strong>Nilai , July 26, 2024 :</strong> A young man was apprehended yesterday at a routine roadblock for attempting to bribe a police officer. The incident occurred when the driver was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Upon being informed that he would receive a ticket for the violation, the man allegedly offered a sum of money to the officer in an attempt to avoid the penalty. The officer, adhering to the strict anti-corruption policies in place, immediately rejected the bribe and placed the man under arrest.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Authorities have charged the individual with attempting to corrupt a public servant, a serious offense under Malaysian law. This incident highlights ongoing efforts to combat corruption within the nation's law enforcement and uphold the rule of law.</p>

                <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;" align="justify">Corruption is a serious and long-standing problem in Malaysia. It not only affects politics, business, and education but also affects Malaysia's reputation. Due to corruption cases in Malaysia, foreign tourists may have doubts about Malaysia's security and fairness. It led to a decrease in tourist and tourism industry revenue. Although the Malaysia government and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) are working hard to crack down on criminals of corruption, corruption still exists in Malaysia. The 1MDB scandal is an example of misusing billions of dollars of state funds and involving top officials in extensive police corruption, demonstrating the seriousness of the issue. The corrupt behavior of senior managers erodes the public's trust in government agencies and hinders fair competition in the market. This has affected the country's economic growth and social stability. Despite its deep-rooted nature, the problem of corruption can be mitigated through the concerted efforts of all sectors of society and continuous reforms.                </p>

                <p style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;" align="justify">Police corruption in Malaysia is a well-known problem involving illegal activities such as bribery, solicitation, and abuse of power. In Malaysia, police corruption is noticeable in different criminal activities such as the discreet request for bribes, commonly referred to as "coffee money". Therefore, individuals are able to avoid issuing tickets through this type of behavior. Law enforcement officers abused their powers and accepted bribes to show leniency when dealing with crimes. This behavior leads the public to think that money can solve everything including bypassing the constraints and sanctions of the law, thereby weakening the binding and deterrent effect of the law. Although the government and different organizations try to solve and strengthen these actions such as imposing more severe punishment, the Malaysian police still cannot be associated with integrity. The root cause of police corruption is not only moral flaws but also the career and financial status of the police is in question. This has resulted in some police officers using illegal ways to earn extra income. Hence, we will explore and study what causes police bribery and the impact of this behavior in Malaysia.</p>            </div>

                <p>Research methodology is a technique and procedure used to identify and analyse information on a specific research topic to ensure that the research results are valid and reliable (Sreekumar, 2023).</p>
                <p> In this study, we employ content analysis to investigate police corruption. The purpose is to understand the causes, information and effects of police corruption. We analyzed a range of sources including news reports, journals and books. We also identified relevant literature by searching for keywords such as “police” and “causes of corruption”. A preliminary review via malaysiamail shows that Malaysia's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score for 2022 was 47 which is the lowest in a decade that prompting a review of police corruption in the country.</p>
                <p>Channel News Asia reports also show that in the past ten years, more than 1,600 police officers in Malaysia have been dismissed due to crimes which shows that there are systemic problems. Abramson & Denenberg, P.C., a professional law firm also states that factors that contribute to police corruption include a lack of accountability, low wages and financial pressures, inadequate training and systemic problems. Reports and case studies show police corruption threatens social security, increases the cost of public services and has a negative impact on the tourism industry through police extortion of tourists as mentioned in the New Straits Times report.</p>
                <p>Overall, our content analysis provides insight into the serious problem of police corruption in Malaysia and highlights the need for effective measures to combat corruption to maintain a fair society.</p>

        <h2 class="h2title">Research Finding</h2>
        <div class="container8 paddingend">
            <div class="con5sub1">
                <h3><u>Lack of accountability and oversight</u></h3>
                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >Police corruption in Malaysia is rooted in poor oversight and weak accountability mechanisms. It has led police officers to believe that they can engage in corrupt activities with impunity. Weak internal controls, ineffective disciplinary actions, and the absence of an independent oversight body exacerbate the problem. The lack of strong oversight allows corruption to flourish because they will face no significant consequences or even their actions will be difficult to detect by relevant authorities. Therefore, they grow bolder. According to Transparency International, the Corruption Perceptions Index 2022 in Malaysia is score of 47 out of 100 (CPI 2022). It is the most severe in ten years and highlights the seriousness of the issue. The combination of these factors has led to the aggravation of the problem of corruption. It emphasizes the need for more effective oversight and accountability measures. (Razak, 2023)</p>            </div>
        
            <div class="con5sub1">
                <h3><u>Low wages and economic pressure</u></h3>
                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Police salaries are often insufficient to support their families or meet their financial needs, which forces some to resort to corrupt practices, such as accepting bribes or engaging in illegal activities to supplement their income. The economic difficulties faced by police officers increase their temptation to seek quick financial gains through corrupt means, thus creating a cycle of corruption. The highly stressful nature of police work, coupled with feelings of underpayment, undervaluing and disrespect from the communities they serve, may lead police officers to view corruption as a form of compensation for their efforts and risks. (Denenberg, 2021) In addition, in an environment where corruption is prevalent, police officers may perceive corrupt behaviour as normal or justified. This perception is further exacerbated by a culture within the police department that either passively tolerates corruption or actively promotes it. When police officers see their colleagues engaging in corrupt activities without consequence, they may feel that such behaviour is acceptable or even expected. Addressing financial pressures, improving working conditions, increasing salaries, providing adequate support and fostering a culture of integrity within the police force are key steps in combating police corruption in Malaysia.</p>    
            </div>
            <div class="con5sub1">
                <h3><u>Inadequate training and systemic factors</u></h3>
                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Inadequate training and systemic factors play a significant role in police corruption in Malaysia. Systemic issues such as a lack of ethics training, poor leadership, and a culture that values loyalty over integrity all contribute to the rise of corrupt behavior. New police officers often feel pressure to abide by these norms to adapt and advance their careers (Denenberg, 2021). Police departments may fail to provide adequate training to prevent corruption, misconduct and violence. New police officers often lack institutionalized moral training. It makes them unaware of their moral and legal obligations and the punishment for participating in corruption. When police corruption is obvious, it usually shows that the police department either condones the culture of corruption or turns a blind eye to it. New police officers may perceive such behavior as the norm and act accordingly. It will perpetuate the cycle of corruption. These systemic problems are solved through comprehensive moral training, strong leadership and a culture that emphasizes honesty.</p>        </div>

                    <h3><u>Threat to social security</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >
                        Police corruption poses a serious threat to the security of society. Police may choose selectively enforce the law in favor of individuals who offer bribes. According to the South China Morning Post, Malaysian police allegedly accepted cash from a British couple to pay for a traffic ticket on a road linking Penang and the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia Police Seek British “van Life” Couple over Traffic Stop Bribery Video, 2024). The alleged police officer in this incident gave the couple two options either to pay a RM300 fine or pay RM100 on the spot. This event shows how bribery enables people to avoid facing legal repercussions. In contrast, individuals who are unable to afford or unwilling to give bribes may face serious legal consequences. Instead of combating crime, a corrupt police force protects criminals and enables criminal behavior to thrive. Police cover-ups enable criminals to continue their illegal activities. It leads to a steady rise in crime, which directly threatens the safety of the public's lives and property. Society's peace and stability are also threatened (Oris I. Jaen, n.d.).</p>                </div>

                        Dr. Budi Widodo who is a legal expert and senior researcher at LIPI emphasized the effects of police corruption on public services. Corruption within the police force bring negatively impacts to a rise in the expenses of public services (Wibison et al., 2024). Police officers spend their time and effort on taking bribes instead of concentrating on law enforcement, leading to the misuse of police resources. Police resources that should be used to maintain public safety and combat crime are wasted on personal benefit. Some police officers may opt to stay quiet and not reveal the unethical actions of their fellow officers (Police Corruption and Police Reforms in Developing Societies: Hope Sr., Kempe Ronald: 9781498731874: Amazon.com: Books, 2024). This has weakened the capacity of law enforcement agencies and led to a significant drop in the efficiency of policing work. Due to police corruption, society's need for and spending on maintaining law enforcement has risen. In order to bridge the gap, the government must allocate additional funds to expand the police presence (Singh, 2022). Therefore, the increase in public services expenses directly affects the country's budget and economic growth.

                    <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">        
                        According to the New Straits Times, Langkawi police are investigating an incident where police officers demanded RM100 from tourists for not wearing crash helmets on 30 January 2024 (Mukhtar, 2024). This kind of corrupt behavior has seriously jeopardized the country's tourism industry. When tourists experience extortion and unfair treatment by the police, they feel unsafe and develop a negative view of the country. These negative experiences can quickly spread through social media. This could increase the effect and possibly result in a major decrease in tourist numbers. (Das & Dirienzo, 2010). Foreign tourists are a crucial source of income for many countries. A decrease in tourism has a direct impact on industries like restaurants, hotels, transportation and so on (The Herald, 2017). Not only that, police corruption once widely reported, it can seriously damage the country's international image and reputation. In the long run, this situation will also lead to a slowdown in the overall economic development of the country (Akamavi et al., 2022).                </div>

                    <h3>TANG YI FEI</h3>
                    <p >This is my first experience participating in the production of a video about corruption. During this process, we collaborate on creating scripts, preparing props and using filming equipment. This project stands out from past projects because it involves thorough script writing, filming and a deeper analysis of corruption. However, I encountered some challenges in this project such as team communication and time management. Sometimes, our team will absence of effective communication. Team members fail to actively share their thoughts or updates, leading to a lack of information flow. In addition, due to improper time planning, we often need to finish the task quickly at the last stage. Therefore, I suggest setting a practical schedule to avoid running out of time. Developing a thorough schedule at the start of the project and setting aside sufficient time for editing and blogging in advance. Not only that, periodic inspections can be carried out in the middle of the project to ensure that all parts are carried out as planned and problems can be found and solved in time. This will enhance the overall project's quality and increase efficiency. 
                        Furthermore, I have gained a fresh insight into scripts. Initially, I perceived the script as a basic concept but it included diverse shooting scenes and dialogue. This discovery has been beneficial to me. Although I was not involved in editing, I learned how to shoot from multiple angles and positions during the shooting process to ensure smooth and coherent editing in the later period. Conducting extensive research and collecting data before filming helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of corruption in Malaysia. Following this project, I discovered the importance of exploring various possibilities and gaining knowledge simultaneously. This experience sparked my interest in filming and heightened my awareness of corruption in Malaysia. Overall, this unique experience has injected new vitality into my campus life.

                            During these few months when I finished this task with my team, I gained valuable insights and learned a lot. One of the key takeaways is the importance of teamwork. Although our collaboration was not the best, the thoughtfulness and teamwork displayed by each member ensured our project ran smoothly. We always support each other when we encounter obstacles and actively discuss and communicate to find the best solution. Through this project, I found that communication was crucial during group assignments. Our communication style favors individual expression and negotiation rather than cohesive coordination. This leads to the lack of clarity and consistency in our collective thinking and goals. The experience of the filming process was inspiring to me. From choosing the theme of the film and developing the script to developing the photographic storyboard, preparing props and researching the shooting, we have cooperated at every stage to achieve the expected results. I also gained a lot of knowledge during the preparation process of the blog activities. I learned web page creation methods, design concepts, content outlines, and gained expertise in a new area. 
<br>Not only that, I study on corruption in Malaysia was an eye-opener for me and gave me a deeper understanding of the issue. Looking back on this experience, I find that positive communication is very important. Every team member should seize the opportunity to express their views, which can produce more innovative and effective ideas. Overall, this assignment enriched my problem-solving skills. It also increased my confidence in trying new approaches and reinforced the value of teamwork. I believe the lessons and additional knowledge gained from this experience will benefit me greatly in my future endeavors.

                    <p>
                            In these six weeks, I have been working as a camera operator in the team. This time shooting a cautionary film on the issue of police corruption in Malaysia. Reflecting on my experiences with the team, I often encountered challenging times and difficult moments, which left a lingering shadow on my mind and body. However, I was able to re-embrace group work, which was very successful through this group assignment. Although we faced many obstacles such as scheduling, filming skills, and miscommunication, we all took the time to discuss the issues together not the one-man show. Everyone has something to do such as homework and mid-term exams, which leads to the need to finish this project in a short time. Besides that, each person's position was clearly defined. We all had a common goal to complete the filming. Everyone entered the project with an optimistic attitude rather than focusing on completing tasks. This was my first time as a camera operator, it brought me a new challenge. Nevertheless, everyone was very patient in teaching me how to achieve the results we wanted. I never got tired of reshooting time and time In contrast, I am glad to feel the team was united.
    <br>In this collaboration, I also realized the importance of planning. Group members have played through their strengths such as being proficient in documentation, creating a blog website, and film editing. I realized that as a camera operator, the lens is not only a tool for recording but also a weapon that can change the future and society. Therefore, more viewers can be inspired to take action against corruption by watching the video. I hope that this cautionary film will awaken more people to the problem of police corruption and resist it. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my group members. Without their help, I would have had a hard time completing this shoot. I am very grateful for the time and effort everyone put in.

                    <p>It was a special experience to complete the task of police corruption in Malaysia. This project provides many learning opportunities for me from the technical skills of shooting and network production to the in-depth understanding of team dynamics and project management. In shooting, I learned the importance of pre-production planning, including making a detailed storyboard and shot list. Moreover, I gained experience in creating a blog. I learned how to use website development tools to build a visually appealing and functional blog, which included creating content outlines and designing attractive ways to present information. One of the most rewarding aspects of this project is working closely with my team. Each team member has a unique advantage. Some people are good at shooting and editing and some people are good at creating compelling stories and carefully handling reports. Despite initial communication difficulties, we have supported each other and solved problems by working together effectively. During this assignment, we faced several challenges particularly time management and coordination. Time constraints required us to work quickly. This taught me the importance of setting deadlines and regularly checking progress to stay on track. Furthermore, technical problems during filming and blog production prompted us to think creatively and find innovative solutions.
                        <br>Researching police corruption in Malaysia provided insights into systemic issues and the impact of corruption on society. This knowledge informed our assignment and expanded my comprehension of the significance of ethical behaviors and transparency. This project is an important milestone in my personal and academic journey, which strengthens my belief in teamwork and effective communication. The skills I acquired will undoubtedly benefit me in future projects, and my understanding of corruption has also aroused my interest in further exploring related topics.

                        In this assignment on corruption, I gained a deeper understanding of the background of police corruption and its impact despite the culture of corruption being a common stain in Malaysia. After in-depth research, I found that there have been numerous cases of police bribery in Malaysia. Recently, the government's efforts to combat corruption have helped lead the country in the right direction. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been working on public awareness through education, speeches, and attending different events to educate the public as well as the upcoming university students about how to deal with corruption. Besides that, I have fully learned the concepts of filming and different ways of filming when conducting short film shoots. Not only that, I have also gained more insights on the sub-plotting. 
<br>Despite facing some challenges in this group assignment, we managed to tackle them one by one. Each group member has completed their respective tasks. Even though this was a short semester and the tasks were urgent, we all cooperated actively and made the overall process work.  In general, this assignment allowed me to get in touch with the subject of "Corruption" which I seldom come into contact with, and allowed me to visualize Malaysian society on the subject of corruption. This is a great opportunity for me, offering valuable experience and an interesting learning process.

                        This project was different from my previous projects because it required a comprehensive effort that included scriptwriting, filming, and an in-depth study of corruption in Malaysia. The long research and joint efforts are attractive which enables us to study this topic in depth. Being a director in a video exposing corruption is a rich experience. This experience gives me a new view of film production and social problems. The short term of this semester leads to a heavy workload. Sometimes there is insufficient information sharing among team members, which highlights the need for better communication strategies and more organized planning. As a video director, I gained significant knowledge about the technical aspects of filmmaking such as the importance of writing a precise script and filming from many viewpoints to ensure smooth editing. This encounter aroused my interest in filming and deepened my understanding of police corruption in Malaysia. Bribery is widespread in the country and new initiatives by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) aim to increase public awareness and promote honesty. Additionally, this experience emphasizes the importance of moral factors in storytelling and the power of media in shaping public discourse. 
<br>Overall, this project is a valuable learning experience. This project has helped me strengthen my teamwork and time management skills, improved my leadership skills, and deepened my understanding of the complexity of solving social problems through creative expression. This not only enriches my academic experience, but also provides a new and exciting challenge for my campus life. At the same time, it also encourages me to seek further exploration in the field of media and communication.

                <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >The founder of Transparency International, Peter Eigen has said that people need to be aware that they have the power to transform a corrupt system (Transparency Int’l, 2018). This one belief emphasizes the importance of individuals or groups in driving systemic change. As a Malaysian citizen, we need to unite preventing corrupt practices to safeguard the well-being of our society and economy. In order to prevent corruption from entering into a deadly cycle, we should act proactively. Therefore, the government can establish a system for reporting corrupt activities anonymously. It is to protect whistleblowers and encourage more people to expose corrupt conduct. Malaysian people are encouraged to participate in combating corruption to help decrease the country's crime rate. We must collaborate as a team to eliminate corruption. By working together, we can forge a more optimistic future for our nation.</p>
