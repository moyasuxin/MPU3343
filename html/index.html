            <p style="width: 26rem;"><strong>Nilai , July 26, 2024 :</strong> A young man was apprehended yesterday at a routine roadblock for attempting to bribe a police officer. The incident occurred when the driver was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Upon being informed that he would receive a ticket for the violation, the man allegedly offered a sum of money to the officer in an attempt to avoid the penalty. The officer, adhering to the strict anti-corruption policies in place, immediately rejected the bribe and placed the man under arrest.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Authorities have charged the individual with attempting to corrupt a public servant, a serious offense under Malaysian law. This incident highlights ongoing efforts to combat corruption within the nation's law enforcement and uphold the rule of law.</p>

            <img src="/image/RM1.png" alt="">
            <p>Research methodology is a technique and procedure used to identify and analyse information on a specific research topic to ensure that the research results are valid and reliable (Sreekumar, 2023).</p>
            <p> In this study, we employ content analysis to investigate police corruption. The purpose is to understand the causes, information and effects of police corruption. We analyzed a range of sources including news reports, journals and books. We also identified relevant literature by searching for keywords such as “police” and “causes of corruption”. A preliminary review via malaysiamail shows that Malaysia's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score for 2022 was 47 which is the lowest in a decade that prompting a review of police corruption in the country.</p>
            <p>Channel News Asia reports also show that in the past ten years, more than 1,600 police officers in Malaysia have been dismissed due to crimes which shows that there are systemic problems. Abramson & Denenberg, P.C., a professional law firm also states that factors that contribute to police corruption include a lack of accountability, low wages and financial pressures, inadequate training and systemic problems. Reports and case studies show police corruption threatens social security, increases the cost of public services and has a negative impact on the tourism industry through police extortion of tourists as mentioned in the New Straits Times report.</p>
            <p>Overall, our content analysis provides insight into the serious problem of police corruption in Malaysia and highlights the need for effective measures to combat corruption to maintain a fair society.</p>

    <h2 class="h2title">Research Finding</h2>
    <div class="container8">
        <div class="con5sub1">
            <h3>1.	Lack of accountability and oversight</h3>
            <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0; " >Police corruption in Malaysia is rooted in poor oversight and weak accountability mechanisms, which have led to police officers believing that they can engage in corrupt activities with impunity. Weak internal controls, ineffective disciplinary actions and the absence of an independent oversight body exacerbate the problem. The lack of strong oversight allows corrupt practices to flourish unchecked, as police officers believe they will not face significant consequences. The severity of the problem is underscored by Malaysia's score of 47 out of 100 on the Corruption Perceptions Index 2022 (CPI 2022), the worst in a decade, according to Transparency International. Weak internal controls and ineffective disciplinary measures further contribute to the growth of corruption, highlighting the urgent need to strengthen accountability and oversight mechanisms to combat the problem. (Razak, 2023)</p>        
        </div>
    
        <div class="con5sub1">
            <h3>2.	Low wages and economic pressure</h3>
            <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Police salaries are often insufficient to support their families or meet their financial needs, which forces some to resort to corrupt practices, such as accepting bribes or engaging in illegal activities to supplement their income. The economic difficulties faced by police officers increase their temptation to seek quick financial gains through corrupt means, thus creating a cycle of corruption. The highly stressful nature of police work, coupled with feelings of underpayment, undervaluing and disrespect from the communities they serve, may lead police officers to view corruption as a form of compensation for their efforts and risks. (Denenberg, 2021) In addition, in an environment where corruption is prevalent, police officers may perceive corrupt behaviour as normal or justified. This perception is further exacerbated by a culture within the police department that either passively tolerates corruption or actively promotes it. When police officers see their colleagues engaging in corrupt activities without consequence, they may feel that such behaviour is acceptable or even expected. Addressing financial pressures, improving working conditions, increasing salaries, providing adequate support and fostering a culture of integrity within the police force are key steps in combating police corruption in Malaysia.</p>    
        </div>
        <div class="con5sub1">
            <h3>3.	Inadequate training and systemic factors</h3>
            <p align="justify" style="margin:0 0 1rem 0;">Inadequate training and systemic factors play a significant role in police corruption in Malaysia. Systemic problems such as lack of ethics training, poor leadership and a culture that values loyalty over integrity contribute to corrupt practices. New police officers often feel pressured to conform to these norms to fit in and advance in their careers. (Denenberg, 2021) In many cases, corrupt police officers are aware of their misconduct but believe that they will not be caught because of inadequate oversight. Police departments may fail to provide adequate training to prevent corruption, misconduct and violence. Specifically, new police officers often lack institutionalized ethics training, leaving them unaware of their ethical and legal obligations and the penalties for engaging in corruption. (Denenberg, 2021) This lack of training serves as a deterrent to ethical behaviour rather than to corruption. When serious police corruption is evident, it is usually an indication that the police department is either condoning a culture of corruption or turning a blind eye to it. New police officers may perceive such behaviour as the norm and act, accordingly, perpetuating the cycle of corruption. Addressing these systemic issues through comprehensive ethics training, strong leadership, and a culture that emphasizes integrity is critical to combating police corruption in Malaysia</p>        </div>
