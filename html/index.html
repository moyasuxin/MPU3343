            <p style="width: 26rem;"><strong>Nilai , July 26, 2024 :</strong> A young man was apprehended yesterday at a routine roadblock for attempting to bribe a police officer. The incident occurred when the driver was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Upon being informed that he would receive a ticket for the violation, the man allegedly offered a sum of money to the officer in an attempt to avoid the penalty. The officer, adhering to the strict anti-corruption policies in place, immediately rejected the bribe and placed the man under arrest.</p>
            <p style="width: 26rem;">Authorities have charged the individual with attempting to corrupt a public servant, a serious offense under Malaysian law. This incident highlights ongoing efforts to combat corruption within the nation's law enforcement and uphold the rule of law.</p>
